            <h2>Best Study Spaces on Campus</h2>
            <p>Finding the perfect study space on campus isn't always easy. Here are my favorite go-to spots and hidden gems I found while exploring!</p>
            
            <h2>1. Library</h2>
            <img src="https://www.worthingtonlibraries.org/sites/default/files/styles/teaser_large/public/images/promotions/1466.30-39%20Worthington%20Park%20Library%20Renovation.jpg?h=a1dd1271&itok=DDsCbwml" alt="library">
            <p>The library is a great place to study, whether you're on your own or with others. You can books study rooms too if you need space to yourself or just want a space for you and your study group to work on something.</p>


            <h2>2. Office Hours</h2>
            <img src="" alt="Group of students studying together">
            <p>Go to office hours!!! It helps a lot! Not only can you ask the profssor and/or TA for help as you work, but you can also work with other students and bond over the struggle</p>
            
            <h2>3. Tutoring Center</h2>
            <img src="" alt="Computer Lab and students studying together">
            <p>If it's not time for office hours, the tutoring center is also a great place. The student tutors there may have taken the same class you did in the past and can help. You can also organize group tutoring sessions for a particular subject.</p>
       
            <h2>4. Cafe/Food courts</h2>
            <img src="" alt="Outside tables">
            <p>You can grab a bite to eat nearby if you get hungry while studying! Bonus if the weather is good enough for you to also lay down on a blanket in the grass</p>
